# EMC-Website

This project complies all of my contributions to the creation of the EMCapital.ro website. PLease note that this is by no means a finished product, but only the part that i have worked on. 

This is a website built for a consulting company. The project uses only HTML, CSS vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks) and PHP. 

Please note that i **do not take credit for the creation of the .admin and .vscode files**, as they came pre-prepared with the domain (.admin) or VSCode (.vscode).

I reccomend viewing the website by opening the *index.html* file in the browswer, as the webiste's server has recently been closed.
